## Project Name :- Car Price Predictor 

Objective:-  To predict used car prices with Machine Learning Techniques.

### Description
Project :- We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Dataset :- Scraped data of used AUDI car listings. 10,000 listings, which have been merged from car owners. The cleaned data set contains information of price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. Then made a more general car value regression model.

ML MODEL : Random Forest Regression

Libraries Used : Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, ScikitLearn

### Usability
1> It can be used to get to know the desired cars in the range one wants to buy in.

2> It can used by the manufacturers for price analysis of the future models.

### Features 
1> It provides all the information of the car in the user input range.

2> The information with more than 95% accuracy.
